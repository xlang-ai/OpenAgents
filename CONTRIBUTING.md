# Contributing to XLang Agents

Welcome and thank you for considering a contribution to XLang Agents! As an evolving open-source project, 
we truly value all forms of contribution – whether it's adding new features, 
refining our infrastructure, enhancing documentation, or resolving bugs.

## 🗺️ Guidelines

### 👩‍💻 Code Contributions

1. **Fork & PR Workflow**: We use a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) model. Please avoid pushing directly to the main repo unless you're a maintainer.
3. **PR Template**: When initiating a pull request, adhere to the provided template. Ensure to link related issues and mention relevant maintainers.

### 🚩 Managing GitHub Issues

1. **Existing Issues**: Explore our up-to-date [issues page](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues) for bugs, suggestions, and feature needs.
2. **Fixing Issues**: If an issue sparks your interest, comment on it to get it assigned to you by a maintainer.
3. **Creating New Issues**: When adding a new issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature. If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.
4. **Stay Updated**: The rapid pace of developments might occasionally lead to outdated issues. Your prompt notifications on such instances would be appreciated.

### 🙋 Need Assistance?

**Developer Experience Matters**: Our vision is to offer a seamless developer setup. If you hit a snag at any point, don't hesitate to reach out to a maintainer. Not only are we here to help, but your feedback also aids in refining the experience for subsequent contributors.
