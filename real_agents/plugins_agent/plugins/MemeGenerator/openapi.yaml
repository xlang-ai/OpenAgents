                  description: The text of the meme. If the user did not specify exactly, create your own based on the user's wishes. By default, use two lines separated by a single newline (unless you know the template requires more, such as the 'Expanding Brain' which requires four lines). Empty lines must not be provided. If it's a retry query, rewrite the text so that the number of non-empty lines equals "correctLineNumber". This field is required.

                  type: boolean
                  description: Indicates whether this is a retry call after an error message was returned. This field is required.
