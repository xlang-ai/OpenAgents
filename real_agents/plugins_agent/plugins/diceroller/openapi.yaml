                    The dice roll expression. Can be in the format of the d20 system (e.g., "4d6") or the Fate system (e.g., "4dF").
                    The d20 system supports complex dice roll expressions, including:
                    - Basic rolls, like "4d6" (roll 4 six-sided dice).
                    - Dice roll modifiers, like "1d20+4" (roll a twenty-sided die and add 4).
                    - Advantage and disadvantage rolls, like "1d20adv" (roll two twenty-sided dice and take the higher result).
                    - Dice roll expressions with multiple parts, like "2d6+1d4" (roll two six-sided dice and one four-sided die and add the results).
                    - Dropping the highest/lowest roll, like "4d6dl1" (roll four six-sided dice and drop the lowest roll) is the wrong syntax. The correct syntax for rolling 4 six-sided dice and dropping the lowest roll is "4d6kh3". This stands for "roll 4 six-sided dice, keep the highest 3".
                    - Sending "help" as the expression will return a list of available dice roll expression types and the URL to the plugin's help page.
